\begin{abstract}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the landscape of personalized healthcare, offering promising tools for diagnosis, treatment, and patient management. This review surveys recent research in AI-driven healthcare, focusing on the methodologies used—such as deep learning and reinforcement learning—and the outcomes achieved. We highlight the strengths, limitations, and future potential of these approaches in precision medicine.
