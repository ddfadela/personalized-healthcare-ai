Article Reference: \cite{article_1}

\subsection*{Overview}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning approach that enhances clinical decision-making by addressing uncertainties and optimizing sequential treatment strategies. This review introduces RL to clinicians, emphasizing how it leverages patient data to generate personalized treatment plans that improve outcomes and resource efficiency. It also explores foundational RL concepts, applications, challenges, and future directions.

\textbf{Categories of RL}
\begin{itemize} \item \textbf{Model-based RL:} Learns a model of the environment to simulate outcomes and make decisions. Example: AlphaZero. \item \textbf{Model-free RL:} Learns policies directly from experience without modeling the environment. Includes: \begin{itemize} \item \textit{Value-based methods:} e.g., Q-learning, SARSA \item \textit{Policy-based methods:} e.g., REINFORCE \item \textit{Hybrid methods:} e.g., Actor-Critic \end{itemize} \end{itemize}

RL shifts AI in healthcare from prediction to actionable, real-time decision-making.

\textbf{Applications in Healthcare}
RL has demonstrated potential in: \begin{itemize} \item Creating personalized treatment plans (e.g., chemotherapy, sedation, insulin dosing) \item Optimizing resource allocation in critical care (e.g., ventilator weaning, sepsis treatment) \item Enhancing adaptive interventions using offline RL and simulation environments \end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation Challenges}
Evaluation is constrained by safety, ethical, and logistical concerns. RL often relies on: \begin{itemize} \item Simulated environments \item Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) methods like FQE and Doubly Robust methods \end{itemize}

\textbf{Implementation Issues}
Practical deployment of RL in healthcare is hindered by: \begin{itemize} \item Challenges in reward function design \item High-dimensional state and action spaces \item Necessity for domain expertise in clinical evaluation \end{itemize}

\textbf{Future Directions}
Future developments may include: \begin{itemize} \item Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) \item Privacy-preserving learning (e.g., Federated Learning) \item Real-time adaptive interventions and decision support \end{itemize}

\textbf{Real-World Examples}
Examples include: \begin{itemize} \item DeepMindâ€™s AlphaZero and AI Clinician for sepsis treatment \item RL-based models for sedation weaning, cancer therapy, and insulin control \item Clinical trials like REINFORCE and glycemic control interventions \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Overview}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an advanced paradigm within artificial intelligence (AI) that is particularly effective in optimizing complex, real-time decision-making processes in healthcare. By learning from continuous feedback, RL enables dynamic adjustments in treatment protocols, efficient resource allocation, and personalized clinical interventions.
